The PHP parsing engine needs a way to differentiate PHP code from other elements in the page.
The mechanism for doing so is known as 'escaping to PHP'. There are four ways to do this 
<?php .....?>
<?...?>
<%...%>
<script language = "PHP">...</script>
PHP is whitespace insensitive dosnt care about how many spaces exist
